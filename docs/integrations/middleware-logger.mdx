title: LoggerEventBusMiddleware
description: Log completed events to stdout and optional file.
---

`LoggerEventBusMiddleware` prints completed event summaries and can also write them to disk.

## Constructor params

- `log_path`: optional filesystem path for log output

## Setup with EventBus

```python
from bubus import EventBus
from bubus.middlewares import LoggerEventBusMiddleware

bus = EventBus(
    name='AppBus',
    middlewares=[LoggerEventBusMiddleware('./events.log')],
)
```

## Behavior

- Logs event summaries when events complete.
- Always prints to stdout.
- If `log_path` is provided, appends the same summary lines to the file.
- Creates parent directories for the log file automatically.
