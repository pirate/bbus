<Tab title="TypeScript">

`bubus-ts` supports all major JS runtimes.

- Node.js (default development and test runtime)
- Browsers (ESM)
- Bun
- Deno

### Browser support notes

- The package output is ESM (`./dist/esm`) which is supported by all browsers [released after 2018](https://caniuse.com/?search=ESM)
- `AsyncLocalStorage` is preserved at emit time and used during handling when available (Node/Bun), otel/tracing context will work normally in those environments
